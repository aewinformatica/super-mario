Notes:
----------------------------------------------------------------
- This is an alpha release that probably shouldn't have 
  been released, but I wanted to see if other people
  could run it.

- The first screen is a graphics select.  I recomend 640x480x16.
  If that doesn't work though try other set ups.

- Possible to get inside walls due to buggy tile detection.

- Doors sometimes cause the map to scroll infintely (press escape).

- Enemies are lame and need to be redone.  

- Projectiles behave...oddly.

- Each level has the same horrible boss for now.

- Playable characters have missing and/or incorrect animations.

- If your FPS is less than 60 try this:
    Press F2 to bring up the console
    Type sel_blit norm and hit enter
    Press escape to exit the console

- To enable joystick:
    Press F2 to bring up the console
    Type input_type joy and hit enter
    Press escape to exit the console
    You cannot configure the button
	lay out as of yet
